----------------------------------------------------------------

myreads app is a simple neet design that provides dark and light mode. 
I focused much more on app optimization to make it fast as I could, I used the [`React.memo()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) to prevent unnecessary rendering as I used the [`useCallback() react hook`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) and [`useMemo() react hook`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo) to make the application faster.

to make this application predictable as able to be I used propTypes with every single component that takes props.

## Install 

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6)

## Features

1. Dividing the books in three sheleves [Reading, Want to read, Read].
2. Shifting books from shelf to other shelfs.
3. Adding new books through searching based on books title and author.
4. Deleting books.

## What's next?

there are some helpful ideas to make this app more useable in the future:

1. using state management framework like [`Readux`](https://redux.js.org/).
2. making user authentication 
3. Make everyone make their own special library. 
3. Create new shelves instead of three for everyone, everyone can make their own shelves.
4. seeing other people's shelves and reacting to them.
5. setting yearly reading goals and give them a way to see their progress.
6. Make a page that shows Competition among users in achieving their goals.

and I believe there are a lot of great ideas that make this app more usable and fun
